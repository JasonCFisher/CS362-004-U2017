Description
===========
Playing the Smithy card through the card effect function causes the current
player to draw only two cards, instead of 3.  This error seems consistently occur whenever the
card is played, regardless of game circumstances.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1. Launch the player executable file and initialize a 2 player game
2. Add the Smithy card to the current player's hand with the following command:  add 13
3. The Smithy card should now be in the current player's hand at position 5
4. Play the Smithy card with the following command:  play 5
5. Check the current player's hand with the following command:  show 


Expected Results
----------------
After playing the Smithy card, the Smithy card should be removed from the current player's hand
and 3 cards should be drawn from the current player's deck.  This means that the current player's hand
should increase by a total of two cards and the deck should decrease by 3 cards.


Actual Results
--------------
The Smithy card is removed from the current player's hand, but only two cards are added to the 
current player's hand, for a total increase of 1 card.  The current player's deck cannot be checked
within the game mode itself, but both manually written and randomly generated test cases have confirmed
that the current player's deck is only decreased by two cards.


Workarounds
-----------
None


Attachments

The suspect code is as follows:

void alteredSmithy(struct gameState *state, int handPos){
	
	int currentPlayer = whoseTurn(state);
	int i;
	      //+3 Cards
    for (i = 1; i < 3; i++)
	{
	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}
			
      //discard card from hand
      discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
      return;
}


Other Information
-----------------
The for loop in the code shown above appears to be incorrect, in that it begins
with i = 1, only loops while i < 3, and increments i in each loop.  This could be fixed
by initializing i to 0 instead of 1, or looping while i <= 3

Title:  Adventurer card draws 1 extra treasure card

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
Playing the Adventurer card causes cards to be drawn from the current player;s deck until 3 
treasure cards have been found, instead of 2 treasure cards.  These 3 treasure cards are added 
to the current player's hand, while all other cards that were drawn are added to the discard pile.  
This error seems consistently occur whenever the card is played, regardless of game circumstances.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1. Launch the player executable file and initialize a 2 player game
2. Add the Adventurer card to the current player's hand with the following command:  add 7
3. The Adventurer card should now be in the current player's hand at position 5
4. Play the Adventurer card with the following command:  play 5
5. Check the current player's hand with the following command:  show 


Expected Results
----------------
The Adventurer card is removed from the current player's hand.  Cards are removed from the 
current player's deck until 2 treasure cards are found.  The 2 treasure cards are added to 
the current player's hand and all other cards that were removed from the deck are placed in the 
discard pile.


Actual Results
--------------
Cards are removed from the current player's deck until 3 treasure cards are found.  All 3 treasure
cards are added to the current player's hand.  All other aspects of this card effect function as 
expected.

The suspect code is as follows:

 void alteredAdventurer(struct gameState *state, int handPos){
  	
  	int drawntreasure = 0;
	int currentPlayer = whoseTurn(state);
	int cardDrawn;
	int temphand[MAX_HAND];
	int z = 0;  //Temp Hand Counter

	  while(drawntreasure<3){  
		if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1){//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
		  shuffle(currentPlayer, state);
		}
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
		cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];//top card of hand is most recently drawn card.
		if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
		  drawntreasure++;
		else{
		  temphand[z]=cardDrawn;
		  state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one).
		  z++;

		}
	  }
	  while(z-1>=0){
		state->discard[currentPlayer][state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++]=temphand[z-1]; // discard all cards in play that have been drawn
		z=z-1;
	  }
	  discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	  return;


  }


Other Information
-----------------
The problem code appears to be as follows:

	while(drawntreasure<3){

This will cause the while loop to repeat 3 times instead of only 2.  Changing it to 

	while(drawntreasure<2){

should fix the problem
